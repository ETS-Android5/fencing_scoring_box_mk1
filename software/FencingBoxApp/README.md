# Arduino Fencing Scoring Box mark 1
# Android repeater application

## Introduction

This Android application for the fencing scoring box project is based on previous software
applications:

- SimpleUsbTerminal by Kai Morich (c) 2019 Kai Morich
- usb-serial-for-android by Mike Wakerly (c) 2013 Mike Wakerly

Due credit and thanks are hereby given to both designers. The license and copyright notices for both

## Brief description

- This is a simple Android application which is intended to be used with the fencing scoring box 
  project.

- Please note that it is not a standalone application - it does not perform scoring or hit detection
  for fencing matches on its own.

- The application is merely a repeater for the fencing scoring box, but it does allow the box to be
  powered from the phone/tablet as well as repeating the box display.
  
- The application was built using Android Studio version 4.2.1.

- The application has been tested on Android 6.0.1 and Android 9 with no known problems.

- More details about the entire project, including the full circuit diagram of the fencing scoring
  box, are in the Word document which is found in the `docs` directory.
